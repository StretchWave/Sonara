/**
 * Resolves a trusted ISRC for a track from whichever source can supply one,
 * and (when a caller-supplied ISRC is already available) cross-checks it so
 * a bad tag can never silently poison an otherwise-correct match.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *  1. Caller-supplied candidate ISRC (local tag / MediaStore / cached
 *     metadata / provider field) — normalized + validated shape only.
 *  2. Deezer catalog search by song+artist (cheap, no auth) — first result
 *     with a matching title/artist/duration wins.
 *  3. Apple Music catalog search by song+artist, using the same shared
 *     token as [AppleMusicCanvasProvider].
 *
 * Every lookup is cached in-memory keyed by (song, artist, durationSeconds)
 * so repeat plays of the same track never re-hit the network — this keeps
 * ISRC resolution off the hot path and safe to call from the UI-adjacent
 * playback pipeline.
